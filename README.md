# ho-ui

ho-ui is the production package for ho-components/-ho-flux apps. It contains a single js file `ho-all.js` that contains all needed dependencies. Furthermore it adds some useful prebuilt components, attributes and stores.

### TODO

* add another view implementation, that manages its html mapping self.
